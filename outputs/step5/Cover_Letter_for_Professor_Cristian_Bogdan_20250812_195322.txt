Dear Professor Bogdan,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the PhD position titled "Advancing Human-Machine Interfaces for Autonomous Electric Vehicles" at KTH Royal Institute of Technology under your esteemed guidance. With a solid foundation in Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction, complemented by extensive experience in programming and interaction design, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the pioneering research themes that align with your expertise in Human-Machine Interaction and Autonomous Vehicles.

My academic and professional journey has been driven by a passion for exploring the dynamics of human-machine interfaces, particularly in complex systems like autonomous vehicles. Having graduated with an M.S. in Solid Mechanics from KTH Royal Institute of Technology, I possess a profound understanding of technical challenges and innovative solutions in engineering mechanics, which I have successfully applied in various AI-driven projects. During my tenure as a Data Scientist and AI Engineer at Bekaert, I developed and deployed machine learning models for real-time analytics, leveraging tools such as Azure Synapse and PySpark. This experience honed my programming skills, particularly in Python, Scikit-learn, and OpenCV, which are crucial for developing advanced interfaces for autonomous vehicles.

Furthermore, my work on sentiment analysis and patent landscaping projects involved implementing sophisticated AI applications, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LangChain, to streamline data processing and enhance decision-making. These projects not only demonstrate my adeptness in AI and machine learning but also underscore my capability to design intuitive interaction models that can significantly impact user experience and system efficiency.

In addition to technical proficiency, my experience in interaction design and software engineering will be instrumental in addressing the complex challenges of human-machine interaction in autonomous transportation systems. My familiarity with mixed and virtual reality technologies opens avenues for creating innovative solutions in external human-machine interfaces and control tower operator interfaces, thereby contributing to the project's goals of enhancing interaction dynamics among various stakeholders.

I am particularly intrigued by the potential collaborative opportunities with industry partners, as mentioned in your research summary. I am eager to learn how such collaborations might enhance the project's outcomes and contribute to the broader objectives of initiatives like "StandUp for Energy." I would be grateful if you could elaborate on these collaborative opportunities, as well as the influence of such initiatives on the scope of your current research projects.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of joining your research team and contributing to groundbreaking advancements in human-machine interfaces for autonomous electric vehicles. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my application further.

Sincerely,  
Yuanyuan Xu
