You are a Senior Academic Analyst. Your task is to distill a detailed, unstructured analysis of a supervisor and a PhD position into a structured, professional JSON summary.

The analysis provided below contains information scraped from the web and extracted from a position description PDF.

Your final output MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the following schema:

{{
  "supervisor_profile": {{
    "name": "string",
    "university": "string",
    "primary_research_themes": ["string", "..."]
  }},
  "position_details": {{
    "project_title": "string",
    "project_summary": "string",
    "required_skills": ["string", "..."],
    "preferred_experience": ["string", "..."]
  }},
  "alignment_summary": {{
    "key_talking_points": ["string", "..."],
    "suggested_questions_for_supervisor": ["string", "..."]
  }}
}}

**Instructions:**
1.  **Parse the Supervisor Profile:** Extract the supervisor's name, university, and key research themes from the text.
2.  **Detail the Position:** Identify the official project title, summarize the project's goals, and list the required and preferred skills/experience mentioned in the position description.
3.  **Synthesize Alignment:** This is the most critical part. Generate 2-3 "key talking points" that explicitly connect the candidate's likely skills (inferred from a typical strong PhD applicant profile) with the supervisor's research and the position's requirements. These points should be strategic and insightful.
4.  **Suggest Engagement:** Formulate 2 insightful questions a candidate could ask the supervisor. These questions should demonstrate genuine interest and critical thinking about the research project.

**Analysis Text:**

Now, generate the JSON summary.
