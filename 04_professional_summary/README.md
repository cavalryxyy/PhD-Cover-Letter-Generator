# Step 4: Professional Summary Generation

## Overview

This step is responsible for transforming the unstructured, detailed analysis from Step 3 into a structured JSON object. It acts as a bridge between the raw data analysis and the final cover letter generation, ensuring that the creative writing step has a clean, concise, and actionable input.

## How It Works

1.  **Input**: Takes the path to a text file generated by Step 3 (e.g., `step3_detailed_analysis_of_Dr_John_Doe.txt`).
2.  **LLM Prompting**: It uses a specialized prompt (`step4_prompts.py`) to instruct an LLM to act as a "Senior Academic Analyst."
3.  **Structured Output**: The LLM parses the input text and generates a structured JSON object containing:
    *   The supervisor's profile.
    *   Key details from the position description.
    *   A synthesized summary of how the candidate aligns with the role.
    *   Suggested insightful questions for the candidate to ask.
4.  **Saves Output**: The resulting JSON is saved to the `outputs/step4/` directory.

## Usage

To run this step, execute the `step4_main.py` script from the project root, providing the path to the analysis file from Step 3:

```bash
python 04_professional_summary/step4_main.py "outputs/step3/step3_detailed_analysis_of_Dr_Some_Name_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt"
```
